Write a function called findMinMax that takes an array of integers, its size, and two integer pointers as output parameters. The function should find the maximum and minimum values in the array and store them in the respective output parameters. The function should have the following prototype:
void findMinMax(int* array, int size, int* max, int* min);
Test Data:
{53, 32, 19, 79, 25, 5 47}
Expected output:
Maximum value: 79
Minimum value: 5
